= opengb.spork.dgrid

- dgrid state represented as a map containing "first class" cols, rows and cells.
- keeps the managing of dgrid state separate from the persistence/reactivity
  strategy (currently supporting either a reagent ratom or re-frame app-db).
- "headless," meaning the intention is that the user write a relatively
  straightforward custom hiccup-based component for the UI, and this library
  will concern itself with providing accessors and mutators for a data
  structure that keeps the state consistent.
- inspired by react-table and d3, which provide useful generalized functions
  around data but leave the DOM representation entirely up to you.
